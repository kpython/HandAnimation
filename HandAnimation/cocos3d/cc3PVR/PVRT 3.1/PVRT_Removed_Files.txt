cocos3d Modifications to PVRT library
------------------------------------------------------------------

To reduce overhead, many unneeded files have been culled from the PVRT
library for use in cocos3d.

Where necessary, the remaining files have been patched to accomodate the
missing files, and these patches have been marked with "patched for cocos3d".
