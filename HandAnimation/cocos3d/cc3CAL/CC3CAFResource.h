#pragma mark Allocation and initialization

/**
 * Initializes this instance and invokes the loadFromFile: method to populate this instance from
 * the contents of the file at the specified cafFilePath.
 *
 * Once loaded, this instance is attached to the CSF resource loaded from the specified csfFilePath
 * by invoking the linkToCSFResource method. The CSF resource is retrieved from the resource cache
 * if it already exists, otherwise it is loaded and cached as well.
 *
 * Normally, you should use the resourceFromFile:linkedToCSFFile: method to reuse the cached
 * instance instead of creating and initializing a new instance. The resourceFromFile:linkedToCSFFile:
 * method automatically invokes this method if an instance does not exist in the resource cache,
 * in order to create and load the resource from the file, and after doing so, places the newly
 * loaded instance into the cache.
 *
 * However, by invoking the alloc method and then invoking this method directly, the application
 * can load the resource without first checking the resource cache. The resource can then be placed
 * in the cache using the addResource: method. If you load two separate resources from the same
 * file, be sure to set a distinct name for each before adding both resources to the cache.
 * By default, the name of the resource is the file name.
 *
 * If you need to set additional configuration info, such as the directory property, prior
 * to loading the resource, consider using the init or resource methods and then invoking
 * the loadFromFile: method instead.
 *
 * The specified file path may be either an absolute path, or a path relative to the
 * application resource directory. If the file is located directly in the application
 * resources directory, the specified file path can simply be the name of the file.
 *
 * This method will return nil if the file could not be loaded.

 * by invoking the linkToCSFResource method. The CSF resource is retrieved from the resource cache
 * if it already exists, otherwise it is loaded and cached as well.
 *
 * Resources loaded through this method are cached. If the resource was already loaded and is in
 * the cache, it is retrieved and returned. If the resource has not in the cache, it is loaded
 * from the specified file, placed into the cache, and returned. It is therefore safe to invoke
 * this method any time the resource is needed, without having to worry that the resource will
 * be repeatedly loaded from file.
 *
 * To clear a resource instance from the cache, use the removeResource: method.
 *
 * To load the file directly, bypassing the cache, use the alloc and initFromFile: methods.
 * This technique can be used to load the same resource twice, perhaps to configure each separately.
 * Each distinct resource can then be given its own name, and added to the cache separately.
 * However, when choosing to do so, be aware that resources often consume significant memory.
 * Consider copying resource components instead of loading the entire resource, if you need
 * to create multiple instances of a few resource components.
 *
 * If you need to set additional configuration info, such as the directory property, prior to
 * loading the resource, consider using the resource method and then invoking the loadFromFile:
 * method to load the file, and the addResource: method to add that instance to the cache.
 *
 * The specified file path may be either an absolute path, or a path relative to the
 * application resource directory. If the file is located directly in the application
 * resources directory, the specified file path can simply be the name of the file.
 *
 * This method will return nil if the file is not in the cache and could not be loaded.

 * export. The specified CSF resource must be from the same export as this CAF resource.
 * Typically, the export package will include a single CSF file and multiple CAF files.
 *
 * The CAF file format contains only the calIndex value of each node, and a single track of
 * animation content. The CSF file format contains node names, locations, rotations, and
 * hierarchical structure.
 *
 * For each node in this CAF resource, this method uses its calIndex property to retrieve the
 * corresponding node contained in the specified CSF resource. Once retrieved, the following
 * content is copied from the node in the CSF resource to the node in this CAF resource:
 *   - node name
 *
 * After the CSF content has been extracted, the wasCSFResourceAttached property of this CAF
 * resource will be set to YES, but the CSF resource is not retained by this CAF resource.
