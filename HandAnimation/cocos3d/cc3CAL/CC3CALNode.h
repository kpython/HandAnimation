/** 
 * A CC3CALNode extracted from a file.
 *
 * During extraction from the file, nodes of this type are related to each other through index values.
 *
 * Only CC3ArrayNodeAnimation should be used for animating this type of node.
 *
 * CAF bones do not contain scale content. When a skeleton model whose bones do contain scale
 * content is exported to a CAF file, the animation location content is incorrectly scaled.
 *
 * To compensate, when using a CC3CALNode to hold animation content loaded from a CAF file, invoke
 * the correctAnimationToSkeletalScale: method, passing the skeletalScale of the node to which the
 * animation contained in the CC3CALNode is to be attached. This should only be done once, and
 * subsequent invocations of that method will be ignored. Consequently, the animation held in a
 * CC3CALNode should only be used to animate bones that have the same skeletalScale.
