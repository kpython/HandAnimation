/**
 * Populates this instance as a rectangular mesh displaying the text of the specified string,
 * built from bitmap character images taken from a texture atlas as defined by the bitmpped font
 * configuration loaded from the specified font configuration file.
 *
 * A compatible bitmap font configuration file, and associated texture, can be created using any
 * of these editors:
 *    http://glyphdesigner.71squared.com/ (Commercial, Mac OS X)
 *    http://www.bmglyph.com/ (Commercial, Mac OS X - also available through AppStore)
 *    http://www.n4te.com/hiero/hiero.jnlp (Free, Java)
 *    http://slick.cokeandcode.com/demos/hiero.jnlp (Free, Java)
 *    http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/ (Free, Windows only)
 *
 * The texture that matches the specified font configuration (and identified in the font configuration),
 * is automatically loaded and assigned to the texture property of this mesh node.
 *
 * The text may be multi-line, and can be left-, center- or right-aligned, as specified.
 *
 * The specified lineHeight define the height of a line of text in the coordinate system of this
 * mesh node. This parameter can be set to zero to use the natural line height of the font.
 *
 * For example, a font with font size of 16 might have a natural line height of 19. Setting the
 * lineHeight parameter to zero would result in a mesh where a line of text would be 19 units high.
 * On the other hand, setting this property to 0.2 will result in a mesh where the same line of text
 * has a height of 0.2 units. Depending on the size of other models in your scene, you may want to
 * set this lineHeight to something compatible. In addition, the visual size of the text will also
 * be affected by the value of the scale or uniformScale properties of this node. Both the lineHeight
 * and scale properties work to establish the visual size of the label text.
 *
 * For a more granular mesh, each character rectangle can be divided into many smaller divisions.
 * Building a rectanglular surface from more than one division can dramatically improve realism
 * when the surface is illuminated with specular lighting or a tightly focused spotlight, or if
 * the mesh is to be deformed in some way by a later process (such as wrapping the text texture
 * around some other shape).
 *
 * The divsPerChar argument indicates how to break each character rectangle into multiple faces.
 * The X & Y elements of the divsPerChar argument indicate how each axis if the rectangle for each
 * character should be divided into faces. The number of faces in the rectangle for each character
 * will therefore be the multiplicative product of the X & Y elements of the divsPerChar argument.
 *
 * For example, a value of {3,2} for the divsPerChar argument will result in each character being
 * divided into 6 smaller rectangular faces, arranged into a 3x2 grid.
 *
 * The relative origin defines the location of the origin for texture alignment, and is specified
 * as a fraction of the size of the overall label layout, starting from the bottom-left corner.
 *
 * For example, origin values of (0, 0), (0.5, 0.5), and (1, 1) indicate that the label mesh should
 * be aligned so that the bottom-left corner, center, or top-right corner, respectively, should be
 * located at the local origin of the corresponding mesh.
 *
 * The vertexContentType property of this mesh may be set prior to invoking this method, to define the
 * content type for each vertex. Content types kCC3VertexContentLocation, kCC3VertexContentNormal, and
 * kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate are populated by this method.
 *
 * If the vertexContentType property has not already been set, that property is set to a value of
 * (kCC3VertexContentLocation | kCC3VertexContentNormal | kCC3VertexContentTextureCoordinate), and
 * the mesh will be populated with location, normal and texture coordinates for each vertex.
 *
 * This method may be invoked repeatedly to change the label string. The mesh will automomatically
 * be rebuilt to the correct number of vertices required to display the currently specified string.
