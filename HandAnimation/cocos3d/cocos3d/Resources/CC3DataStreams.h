/** 
 * CC3DataReader sequentially reads data from the bytes managed by a NSData object.
 *
 * Reading starts at the beginning of the data bytes contained in the NSData object.
 * As each element is read, the pointer is advanced to the beginning of the next element.
 *
 * If an attempt is made to read beyond the end of the contained data, the element reading
 * methods will return a default value, and the value of the wasReadBeyondEOF property is
 * set to YES. You can test the value of this property after each read, or once reading is
 * complete in order to determine if an unexpected end of data was encountered.
