/**
 * CC3NodesResource is a wrapper class around a resource structure loaded from a data file
 * containing 3D resources. It handles loading model and texture data from files, and
 * creating CC3Nodes from that data.
 *
 * The loadFromFile: method is used to load this resource. Once this method has been
 * successfully invoked, access to 3D data objects loaded from the file is through
 * the nodes property, which contains the root nodes of a structural 3D node assembly
 * constructed from the 3D data loaded from the file.
 *
 * As shortcuts, there are also class and instance initialization methods that will
 * invoke the loadFromFile: method automatically during instance initialization.
 *
 * However, before using any of these shortcut methods, you should take into consideration
 * whether you need to set the directory or expectsVerticallyFlippedTextures properties
 * prior to loading, as explained here.
 *
 * By default, additional resources (typically textures), are loaded from the same
 * directory that the file containing the content of this resource is located.
 * If this is not the case, you can set the directory property prior to invoking
 * the loadFromFile: method, in order to establish another directory from which
 * additional resources such as textures will be loaded.
 *
 * You do not need to set the directory property if these additional resources
 * are in the same directory as the file loaded by this resource.
 *
 * Under iOS, a texture whose width and height are not each a power-of-two, will be converted
 * to a size whose width and height are a power-of-two. The result is a texture that can have
 * empty space on the top and right sides. If the texture coordinates of the mesh do not take
 * this into consideration, the result will be that only the lower left of the mesh will be
 * covered by the texture.
 * 
 * In addition, the vertical axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted
 * relative to the iOS view coordinate system. This results in textures being
 * displayed upside-down, relative to the OpenGL coordinate system.
 *
 * This instance will automatically adjust the meshes to compensate for this. Meshes loaded
 * by this resource loader will have their texture coordinates adjusted to align with the usable
 * area of an NPOT texture, and to vertically flip a texture that has been loaded upside-down.
 *
 * To determine whether textures will need to be vertically flipped, the loader needs to know
 * whether or not the meshes have already been flipped (by the 3D editor or file exporter).
 * The expectsVerticallyFlippedTextures property can be set to indicate to the loader whether
 * the texture coordinates have already been flipped. If the value of this property needs to
 * be changed, it should be set before the file is loaded.
 *
 * The class-side property defaultExpectsVerticallyFlippedTextures can be
 * used to set all instances to load one way or the other.
 *
 * This is an abstract class. Specific subclasses will load files of specific types.
 *
 * Subclasses must override the primitive template method processFile:. All other
 * loading and initialization methods defined by this class are implemented using
 * this primitive method, and subclasses do not need to override any of these other
 * loading and initialization methods.
 *
 * Subclasses should ensure that the nodes array property is fully populated upon
 * successful completion of the processFile: method.

#pragma mark Aligning texture coordinates to NPOT and iOS-inverted textures

/**
 * Indicates whether the texture coordinates of the meshes that will be loaded by this
 * resource loader expect that the texture will be flipped upside-down during texture loading.
 * 
 * The vertical axis of the coordinate system of OpenGL is inverted relative to the  CoreGraphics
 * view coordinate system. As a result, some texture file formats may be loaded upside down. Most
 * common file formats, including JPG, PNG & PVR are loaded right-way up, but using proprietary
 * texture formats developed for other platforms may result in textures being loaded upside-down.
 *
 * If the value of this property is YES, the texture coordinates of meshes loaded by this resource
 * loader will be assumed to have already been flipped vertically, (typically by the 3D editor or
 * file exporter) to align with textures that will be vertically flipped by the texture loader.
 *
 * If the value of this property is NO, the texture coordinates of meshes loaded by this resource
 * loader will be assumed to have their original orientation, and aligned with textures that have
 * not been vertically flipped by the texture loader.
 *
 * The value of this property is then used to cause the meshes to automatically
 * correctly align themselves with the orientation of any texture applied to them.
 *
 * For meshes that are based on vertex arrays, this property is used to set the same property on
 * each CC3VertexTextureCoordinates instance created and loaded by this resource. When a texture
 * is assigned to cover the mesh, the value of that CC3VertexTextureCoordinates property is used
 * in combination with the value of the isFlippedVertically property of a texture to determine
 * whether the texture coordinates should automatically be reoriented when displaying that texture.
 * 
 * The initial value of this property is determined by the value of the class-side
 * defaultExpectsVerticallyFlippedTextures property at the time an instance of this class
 * is created and initialized. If you want all meshes to behave the same way, with respect
 * to this property, set the value of that class-side property.
